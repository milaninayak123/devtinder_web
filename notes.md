to get node_modules , do npm i


tailwind will be tracked in the files mentioned in tailwind.config.js.
 content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  like these files.
  in all these files , tailwind will be used.
  we gave this path and did such config because tailwind will be used here.

  ---------------------
  tailwind is the css framework.
  we will also use another design component library i.e daisyUI.

  remember when working with react you are working with jsx but not html.
  always copy the code of jsx.
